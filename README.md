# ASP.Net CORE Sample Project

This is a simple ASP.Net Sample for use with ASP.Net core and the [Bitnami docker container for ASP.Net Core](https://github.com/capescuba/dotnet-dev-container.git)

The project is simply the implementation from the Microsoft ASP.Net documentation [Getting Started](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started.html)

The [Bitnami docker container for ASP.Net Core](https://github.com/capescuba/dotnet-dev-container.git) will clone this project to a local `dotnetapp` directory if no 
such directory exists as a basic starting point - users should feel free to fork from this to start their own projects.
